# Testing React components with Karma runner - example

![Running tests](https://draftin.com:443/images/29524?token=Pe5rMPbDhD_GwYzzq3Urg91Uj2aFI1vN8EqR_wsS5Xplty3vCrGe2MqDgS98S7iwxbIFGQBPzdRy_hWvVysQHo8) 

This is the example code for my [companion article on testing React modules](https://www.toptal.com/react/how-react-components-make-ui-testing-easy). Following this code you can take your front-end testing beyond unit tests and achieve the following:

  * a way to test user events
  * test the response to those events
  * make sure the right things render at the right time
  * run tests in many browsers
  * re-run tests on file changes
  * work with continuous integration systems
